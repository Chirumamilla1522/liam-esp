# Liam-ESP external available API

The software for the Liam-ESP mower was built to easy integrate with homeautomation systems, mobile apps and third-party softwares. To support as many systems as possible we offer several ways to communicate with the mower over WiFI.

## REST

One of the most common ways of interacting with external devices today is over a [REST-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API sending [JSON-data](https://www.json.org/) over HTTP.  All available functionallity of the mower is available from the REST-API exposed, the mowers User Interface uses this API and thus everything you can controll from the UI can also be controlled from this API.

## Web socket


## MQTT
