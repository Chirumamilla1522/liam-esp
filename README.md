## Introduction

_A project for building your own robotic lawn mower._

The concept and basic ideas are sprung from the ["Liam lawn mower"](https://github.com/sm6yvr/liam) and [ArduMower](https://www.ardumower.de/index.php/en/) projects, but instead of using an Arduino for controlling the mower this project makes use of the more powerful "Espressif ESP32" microcontroller. The ESP32 boosts more CPU power and memory than a average Arduino, leaving us with less limits but still at a low price.

Here are some of the features of this project:

- Automatic mowing of lawn using a two wheeled robot.
- GNSS-RTK navigation support, for accurate mowing and path planning.
- WiFi connected docking station that relays communication to mower over a LoRa-connection.
- Easy to use REST-based API with Swagger support, making it a breeze to integrate with Home automation softwares.
- Monitor mower using [MQTT protocol](documentation/api.md) (works with most Home automation systems).
- Realtime monitoring using Websocket.
- Built in support for scheduled mowing (time of day, days of week).
- Obstacle avoidance using ultrasound transducers.
- Support accelerometer, gyroscope, and e-compass to keep mower on a straight line, and detect if mower has flipped over (safety reasons).
- Integrated Web UI in docking station for controlling and monitoring mower, see [demo site](http://liam.smart-home.rocks/). (username: admin, password: liam)

**This repository only contains hardware schematics and firmware for the mower, the [docking station has its own project](https://github.com/trycoon/liam-dockingstation)!**
