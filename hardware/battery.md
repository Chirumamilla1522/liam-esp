## Li-ion batteries

The mower could be run on a variety of batteries, from lead-acid to lithium polymer (LiPo), but lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries could be the sweet spot. Li-ion batteries are lighter and can store more energy than lead-acid and are cheeper and safer than Li-Po batteries.

You could buy [ready made battery packs](https://www.google.com/search?q=li-ion+battery+pack+%2B14.4v) on the Internet, but it is also possible to make your [own battery packs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGp7cGBYOLc) (if unsure, don't do it!). Either way the battery pack should be able to deliver at least 4 ampere continually and 6 ampere temporally to support the power hungry motors in the mower. It is also important that the battery pack is equipped with a protective circuit for overcharge, over-discharge and short circuit!

If you take on the quest to build your own battery pack, then these battery cells could be suitable [Samsung INR18650-15M](https://secondlifestorage.com/t-Samsung-INR18650-15M-Cell-Specifications) and [Samsung INR18650-30Q](https://secondlifestorage.com/t-Samsung-INR18650-30Q-Cell-Specifications).

## Balancer Management System (BMS) cards for Li-ion batteries

For optimal use the battery packs should be fitted with a [BMS-card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_management_system) to protect the cells and help balancing cells during charge-phase.

Suitable BMS-cards:
